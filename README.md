# PHPStormSettings
My personal settings; code style and inspections, theme and preferences for JetBrains' PHPStorm (IntelliJ Platform).

## Compatibility
This repository is generated by the configuration files from PHPStorm, but should be compatible with other **IDEs from JetBrains**
including IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, AppCode, CLion, Gogland, Rider and Android Studio.

However please note this is **not compatible** with the "SettingsRepository"-Plugin that is by default enabled in at least some of them.
Since the plugin caused a lot of trouble for many, this particular repository does things a little bit more old skool.

Also i've **only** taken Microsoft operating systems into account. If you're modifying some things to make it work 
on a different OS in a generic way, please submit a PR.

## Installation
1. Close PHPStorm.
2. Rename `%userprofile%/PHPStormXXXX.XX/config` adding `.bak` to the end.
3. Clone this Repo into `config` folder.
4. Start PHPStorm.
5. Choose your keymapping profile under `Settings->Keymap`. Personally I prefer the Visual Studio profile.
6. Install anything that uses a path in the config, e.g. NodeJS.
7. Enjoy!

## Usage
Sync any settings by committing changes to your fork and loading 
them on a different machine like explained in the install section.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History
I have been using PHPStorm at work as well as at home or on a 
substitute machine when one was broken. At first it was not too much effort to simply set some things up on another machine, 
but as settings get more fine-tuned it can become increasingly annoying to do so. A repository with settings was born.

## Credits
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for having such a nice settings system, where only non-default settings are being saved in most cases
